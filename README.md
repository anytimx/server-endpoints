# Server Endpoints

This repository provides a list of alternative server endpoints that you can use to access the application whenever the main service endpoint is unavailable.

## Introduction

Due to various reasons, such as network issues or service maintenance, the main server might become unreachable. In such cases, to ensure uninterrupted access to our services, we maintain a list of backup server endpoints that you can use.

## How to Use

When you are unable to reach the main service, follow these steps to use an alternative server endpoint:

1. Check the list below for an available alternative endpoint.
2. Configure your application to use the new endpoint by updating the server configuration settings.
3. If the application requires a restart, make sure to do so for the changes to take effect.

## List of Server Endpoints

The following is a list of the current alternative server endpoints that are available:

Please note that the availability of these endpoints is subject to change, and they may be updated periodically.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues with the alternative server endpoints, please report them through [issue tracking](https://github.com/anytimx/server-endpoints/issues).

## Contributions

Contributions to this list are welcome. If you know of an additional server endpoint that could be included, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
